## distance sensor 

### Description & Code Snippets
In this assignment, we used a distance sensor to make a light change color. The light changed colors by how far my hand was from the sensor. My serial monitor printed off "KEIRA F'ed up" to show that it was working and saw my hand.

### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

### Reflection
In conclusion, this was kinda easy but my serial monitor wasn't listening to my sensor which was very annoying. I at first thought it was my wiring so I unwired and rewired just for that not to be the problem. lastly, I thew a fit and of course, and Mr.Helmstetter fixed it!! Turns out it was something in my code.

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.

### Assignment Description
This assignment was to get back in the feel of onshape. we used things like Extrude, sketch, fillet, and mating, etc.

### Reflection
on the hanger assignment It was the first assignment reintroducing onshape. we used almost all the tools we would need on onshape to build our own project. But, I will say the most challenging thing was holes. I struggle with circles because for one I don't enjoy walking, drawing, or onshaping circles, So it was definitely difficult. in all seriousness, This whole assignment was hard because it had been a minute since we did onshape and I can't lie I forgot what I was doing.
